# 01 â€“ Setting up your enviroment

Whooohooo! ðŸ¥³
Welcome to your very first few steps into Metal development on macOS!
 
This tutorial will hopefully help you set up a proper and efficient development environment so you can start building high-performance graphics applications.

## Why Xcode?

Although it's technically possible to use other editors, **Xcode** is the standard and recommended environment for Apple platforms. Using anything else will quickly lead to frustration and unnecessary complications.

## Why C++?

Metal is traditionally used with [Objective-C](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Objective-C) and [Swift](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Swift_(programming_language)). However, as graphics programmers, we need fine control and maximum performance. That's why **C++** is the preferred choice in the industry today.

To bridge the gap between Objective-C and C++, Apple provides official **C++ bindings** for Metal â€” allowing modern C++ development while maintaining compatibility with Metalâ€™s API.

We'll also make use of **Objective-C++**, a hybrid that allows both languages to coexist in the same source file.

## âœ… Requirements

- A Mac (obviously)
- The latest version of **Xcode** (e.g., _16.4_ at time of writing)
- Basic familiarity with:
  - Swift
  - Objective-C
  - C++
- A sense of curiosity (and perhaps a table to occasionally bang your head against)

---

## Step 1: Install Xcode

![step1](assets/step1.png)

If you havenâ€™t already, download Xcode from the [Mac App Store](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/xcode/id497799835) or from the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

Ensure you're using **Xcode 9.3 or later**, which includes support for **C++17**, required by Metalâ€™s C++ bindings.

---

## Step 2: Download the Metal C++ Bindings

Download Appleâ€™s official [metal-cpp bindings](https://developer.apple.com/metal/cpp/).

---

## Step 3: Create a New Xcode Project

1. Open **Xcode**
2. Go to: `File â†’ New â†’ Project â†’ macOS â†’ Command Line Tool`
3. Set the product name to something like `MyMetalApp`
4. Select **C++** as the language

![step2](assets/step2.png)

This will create a simple terminal-based C++ app as your starting point.

---

## Step 4: Add `metal-cpp` to the Project

Drag and drop the downloaded `metal-cpp` folder into your project.

Make sure:
- You **copy items if needed**
- The **target** is set to your app (`MyMetalApp`)

## Step 5: Configure Build Settings

We need to tell Xcode where to find the `metal-cpp` headers.

1. Select the **target** (`MyMetalApp`)
2. Go to **Build Settings**
3. Set **Always Search User Paths** to `Yes`

![step5](assets/step5.png)

4. Still in **Build Settings**, search for `Header Search Paths`
5. Add the following entry:
```bash
$(PROJECT_DIR)/metal-cpp
```
