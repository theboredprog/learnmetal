# 01 - Setting Up Your Environment

This tutorial will guide you through the first steps to start programming with Apple's Metal API.

## What You’ll Need

- A Mac running macOS with Xcode installed (latest version recommended).
- Basic knowledge of Swift or Objective-C (Swift preferred).
- A willingness to experiment and learn!

## Step 1: Install Xcode

If you haven’t installed Xcode yet, get it from the Mac App Store or [Apple Developer](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/).

## Step 2: Create a New Metal Project

1. Open Xcode.
2. Select **File > New > Project**.
3. Choose **App** under iOS or macOS.
4. Set your project name (e.g., "LearnMetalApp").
5. Make sure **Metal** is enabled under the Graphics API settings.
6. Click **Create**.

## Step 3: Run the Default Metal App

Build and run the project. You should see a simple rotating 3D object rendered using Metal.

Congratulations! You have successfully set up your first Metal project.

Next, we’ll explore the basics of Metal’s architecture and how to create your own shaders.

> **Note:** Metal requires a GPU that supports Metal. Most Macs from 2012 onward support it.
