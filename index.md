# Welcome to Learn Metal

**Learn Metal** is a personal, open-source project dedicated to teaching Apple’s Metal graphics API — especially its latest version.  
Whether you're diving into graphics programming for fun, study, or your next big idea, feel free to explore this site. I’m building it in my spare time, purely out of passion for coding and sharing what I learn along the way.

### A Quick Thank You First

This site wouldn’t exist without the amazing work of [Joey De Vries](http://joeydevries.com/#home) and his legendary [LearnOpenGL](https://learnopengl.com) tutorial.  
I also owe a lot to other brilliant resources like [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) and [directxtutorial](http://www.directxtutorial.com/Lesson.aspx?lessonid=9-4-1).

These projects were my go-to study materials for years, and they’re a huge reason why I’m creating this in the first place — to pay it forward.

Massive thanks to all the authors!

### “Okay, but why should I follow this tutorial?”

As of **July 18, 2025**, high-quality, beginner-friendly resources on Metal are still hard to come by. Most searches lead you to:

- [https://metaltutorial.com](https://metaltutorial.com) — great, but could go deeper.
- [Apple’s Official Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Metal/) — thorough, but tough to piece together if you're just starting out.

I wanted to learn Metal from the ground up *and* help fill this gap in the ecosystem. So this site is both a personal learning journey and a resource for anyone who wants a clearer, more structured way into Metal development.

If it helps you, then mission accomplished.
