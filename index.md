# Welcome to Learn Metal

Welcome to **Learn Metal**, an open-source tutorial site dedicated to learning and mastering Apple’s Metal graphics API, specifically its newest iteration.
Whether you are interested in learning Metal for academic purposes or just as a hobby for your personal projects, feel free to explore this website i'm making in my free time, purely for the love of programming and sharing what i learn along the way :)

**But first, the proper acknowledgements**

This website probably wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for the wonderful work by [Joey De Vries](http://joeydevries.com/#home) regarding [learnopengl](https://learnopengl.com) and many other brilliant websites like [vulkan-tutorial](https://vulkan-tutorial.com) and [directxtutorial](http://www.directxtutorial.com/Lesson.aspx?lessonid=9-4-1).

These have been subjects of my studies for many years in the past, and they are also the main reason why i myself and making this in the first  place!

Soooo thanks to all the authors! 

**"Ok but why should i follow these tutorials?"**

At the time of writing this (Fri Jul 18 2025), there really aren't that many resources to properly learn the Metal Graphics Api, apart from the most common results you get when you search for it:
- [https://metaltutorial.com](https://metaltutorial.com) - great, but i think it could be more detailed
- [Apple's Official Documentation](https://developer.apple.com/documentation/Metal/) - great stuff, but it's really difficult to connect everything together, so not so intuitive

So naturally, me being interested in learning Metal from the ground up, but also wanting to fill a void that hasn't been filled yet, i've thought about creating this website in hopes that i understand what i'm doing better and hopefully, help someone else in the process as well :)
